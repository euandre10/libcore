# Libcore.

### About this project.
While i was practicing and trying to complete all functions of the ‘Libft’ project from 42SP, i was inspired to create my own library of functions in C, just to keep practicing and learning more about the language itself. Overall, the functions are just a “copy” made from the already existing functions, mainly from **libc**, using only **malloc, free** and **write** functions to build them.

Most of the functions are very simple and just requires a little knowledge in **loops**, **conditionals**, **pointers** and **functions** to work.

I'm currently using Windows 11 with WSL2 with an Arch Linux build to code and make all the files.

### TL/DR.
• I made brief comments in each '.c' function file explaining how it works and how to use it using **Doxygen**.<br>
• Here's a link to my **Notion** doc. about this project: https://shre.ink/xUG4<br>
• You can clone this lib/project using the following command: 'git clone https://github.com/euandre10/libcore.git'.<br>
• Feel free to use/change all the code according to your needs.<br>
