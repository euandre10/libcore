# Libcore.

While i was practicing and trying to complete all functions of the ‘Libft’ project from 42SP, i was inspired to create my own library of functions in C, just to keep practicing and learning more about the language itself. Most of the functions are very simple and just requires a little knowledge in **loops**, **conditionals**, **pointers** and **functions** to work.

Overall, the functions are just a “copy” made from the already existing functions, mainly from **libc**, using only **malloc, free** and **write** functions to build them.

I'm currently using Windows 11 with WSL2 with an Arch Linux build to code and make all the projects.

Here's a link to my **Notion** doc. about this project: https://shre.ink/xUG4
